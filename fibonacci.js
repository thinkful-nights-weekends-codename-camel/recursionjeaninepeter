// Write a recursive function that prints the Fibonacci sequence of a given number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the 2 preceding numbers. For example, the 7th Fibonacci number in a Fibonacci sequence is 13. The sequence looks as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.
